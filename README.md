Separation of concerns – ViewModel handles logic, Activity observes state.
State management with StateFlow – Reactively updates UI.
MVI architecture – Makes the app more scalable and testable.
Repository pattern – Can easily add network calls, caching, or a database, BetRepository handles data, while ViewModel only updates state.
                    als it's Unit testing friendly
Immutable bet object !
Ensures encapsulation – No raw strings, everything is a structured type.
